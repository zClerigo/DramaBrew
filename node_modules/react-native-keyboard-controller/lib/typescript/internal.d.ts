 * TS variant of `useAnimatedValue` hook which is added in RN 0.71
 * A better alternative of storing animated values in refs, since
 * it doesn't recreate a new `Animated.Value` object on every re-render
 * and therefore consumes less memory. We can not use a variant from
 * RN, since this library supports earlier versions of RN.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/e22217fe8b9455e32695f88ca835e11442b0a937
